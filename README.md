# WEEK-1-CLIMATE-RISK-AND-DISASTER-MANAGEMENT

This project uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to assist in disaster risk management at a global scale. By analyzing historical disaster data, climate factors, geographical information, and socio-economic variables, the model aims to predict disaster-prone areas and assist in early warning systems for more effective disaster management.

The project focuses on creating a data-driven model that can forecast the occurrence of natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, wildfires, etc.) based on a combination of features such as weather patterns, geographical data, population density, and infrastructure vulnerabilities.
